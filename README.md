Experiment with giphy API

https://lordsorcerer.github.io/GifTastic/

The giphy API allows you to search for .gif images based on certain parameters.  I used it in this Travel themed page to allow uses to view pictures from different countries.  The color scheme was chosen to match the background image I found and the borders are dashed to be reminiscent of the edges of postage stamps.

Screenshot1 shows images from China and screenshot2 shows the button the user has added, featuring images from The Moon.  Someone apparently has a very, very large travel budget.

#Tradan-Air, a travel themed image display page

https://lordsorcerer.github.io/tradan-air/index.html

An experiment with the Giphy API. Provides users with the ability to view animated gifs from select countries around the world or add their own search key.The color scheme was chosen to match the background image I found and the borders are dashed to be reminiscent of the edges of postage stamps.

Screenshot1 shows images from China and screenshot2 shows the button the user has added, featuring images from The Moon.  Someone apparently has a very, very large travel budget.
